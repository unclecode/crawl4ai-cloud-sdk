## Hey, Beautiful People!

This is **Uncle Code**.

You know [Crawl4AI](https://github.com/unclecode/crawl4ai). We built it together — you, me, and this incredible community. It became the **de facto standard for self-hosting** — the most-starred web crawler on GitHub. Battle-tested by developers worldwide. I am so proud of us.

We built it because **access to data must be democratized**. That principle hasn't changed.

Now I'm bringing it to the cloud.

---

## Why Cloud?

Same principles. Same policies. But now:

- **More accessible** — No browser setup, no Playwright headaches, no infrastructure to manage
- **More affordable** — Serious crawls without breaking the bank
- **Faster and smarter** — Not by cutting quality, but through intelligent creativity

The API you love, zero setup:

```python
from crawl4ai_cloud import AsyncWebCrawler

async with AsyncWebCrawler(api_key="sk_live_...") as crawler:
    result = await crawler.run("https://example.com")
    print(result.markdown.raw_markdown)
```

**That's it.** Your existing Crawl4AI code works with minimal changes. See the [SDK Documentation](./SDK.md) for Python, Node.js, and Go.

---

## We Need You (Again)

Here's the truth: **Crawl4AI open source became so solid because you complained loudly — and I love that.**

We need to do the same thing here.

This is version one. It will have issues. It will have bugs. The whole server might crash during the first week. **But we love it.** We're going to continue building every day.

I am a developer, and I love to build.

## Get Started

### 1. Join the Beta

<p align="center">
  <a href="https://api.crawl4ai.com/register?code=CRAWL4AI-BETA-2026">
    <strong>api.crawl4ai.com</strong>
  </a>
</p>

Sign up, get your API key (`sk_live_...`), and start crawling.

### 2. Install the SDK

```bash
pip install crawl4ai-cloud          # Python
npm install crawl4ai-cloud          # Node.js
go get github.com/unclecode/crawl4ai-cloud-sdk/go  # Go
```

### 3. Crawl

```python
from crawl4ai_cloud import AsyncWebCrawler

async with AsyncWebCrawler(api_key="sk_live_...") as crawler:
    result = await crawler.run("https://example.com")

## The Vision

Crawling is just the beginning.

I've always had an eye for **context and refined data** — to make intelligence truly useful. Whether you're building an app, an agent, or something to help humanity, I hope Crawl4AI Cloud can be a part of it.

Let's build the next de facto standard — this time for the cloud.
